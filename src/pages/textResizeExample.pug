In this chapter, we examine the commerce power solely as a source of congressional authority; its function as a limitation on state power is treated in a separate chapter beginning <span style="font-style:Italic;">infra</span>, p.&nbsp;<a href="../Ch06/Ch06.htm#XREF_40310__Chapter_67">73</a>. </p><p class="_L4Text"><b><span class="indent-span"><b><a id="8545" name="330__L4Capt_8545"></a>C.</b></span><span>​</span>Chronological approach:</b> Our approach to the federal commerce power will be a chronological one, so that development of the power may be clearly seen. Our discussion begins with the landmark commerce-power case of <span style="font-style:Italic;">Gibbons v. Ogden</span>, proceeds through the late nineteenth and early twentieth century cases, details the broadening scope of the commerce power beginning in 1937, and then covers some post-1995 cases limiting that scope. </p><p class="_L2Capt"><span class="indent-span"><a id="8549" name="330__L2Capt_8549"></a>II.</span><span>​</span><a id="19333" name="XREF_30779__II__CASES_PRIOR_TO_19333">CASES PRIOR TO 1933 </a></p><p class="_L4Text"><b><span class="indent-span"><b><a id="8551" name="330__L4Capt_8551"></a>A.</b></span><span>​</span><a id="3" name="XREF_22812_3">The groundwork&nbsp;— </a><span style="font-style:Italic;">Gibbons v. Ogden:</span></b> <a id="8553" name="330__L4Text_8553"></a> The first major case construing the Commerce Clause was a Marshall opinion,<span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">Gibbons v. Ogden</span>, 9 Wheat. 1 (1824). Although the <span style="font-style:Italic;">Gibbons</span> opinion contained some discussion of the Commerce Clause as a limitation upon state powers, its principal interest is for its broad-sweeping view of <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">congressional power</span> under that clause. </p><p class="_L6Text"><b><span class="indent-span"><b>1.</b></span><span>​</span>Facts of <span style="font-style:Italic;">Gibbons:</span></b> Ogden acquired, by grant from the New York legislature, monopoly rights to operate steamboats between New York and New Jersey. Gibbons began operating steamboats between New York and New Jersey, in violation of Ogden’s monopoly; Gibbons’ boats were licensed, however, under a federal statute. Ogden obtained an injunction in a New York court ordering Gibbons to stop operating his boats in New York waters. </p><p class="_L6Text"><b><span class="indent-span"><b>2.</b></span><span>​</span>Holding:</b> When the case came to the Supreme Court, Justice Marshall found the injunction against Gibbons invalid, on the ground that it was based upon a monopoly that conflicted with a valid federal statute, and thus violated the Supremacy Clause. </p><p class="_L6Text"><b><span class="indent-span"><b>3.</b></span><span>​</span><a id="3" name="XREF_23557_3">Broad view of commerce power:</a></b> <a id="8565" name="330__L6Text_8565"></a> In reaching this conclusion, Marshall took a broad view of Congress’ powers under the Commerce Clause. Under that clause, he said, Congress could legislate with respect to <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">all</span> “commerce which concerns more States than one.” “Commerce,” he concluded, included not only buying and selling, but <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">all “commercial intercourse.” </span></p><p class="_L8Text"><b><span class="indent-span"><b>a.</b></span><span>​</span>May affect intrastate matters:</b> Ogden apparently argued that insofar as his New York-granted monopoly affected his rights in New York waters, this monopoly was superior to any federal rights regarding those New York waters. But Marshall answered that the congressional power to regulate interstate commerce included the ability to <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">affect matters occurring within a state</span>, so long as the activity had some commercial connection with another state. Thus federal law could affect New York waters, if voyages beginning in New York ended in New Jersey. (But Marshall conceded that “[t]he completely internal commerce of a State&nbsp;…&nbsp;may be considered as reserved for the State itself.”) </p><p class="_L8Text"><b><span class="indent-span"><b>b.</b></span><span>​</span>May be used to “utmost extent”:</b> In the most important portion of his opinion, Marshall stated that <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">no area of interstate commerce is reserved for state control</span>. That is, the mere existence of the states does not by itself act as a limit upon Congress’ power to govern commercial matters that affect more than one state: “This power, like all others vested in Congress, is complete in itself, may be exercised to its utmost extent, and acknowledges no limitations, other than are prescribed in the constitution.” </p><p class="_M4Text"><b><span class="indent-span">i.</span><span>​</span>Tenth Amendment no bar:</b> Thus Marshall implicitly rejected the argument that the Tenth Amendment (which provides that “[t]he powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively&nbsp;…&nbsp;”) acts as an independent limit on Congress’ power to regulate interstate commerce. </p><p class="_L6Text"><b><span class="indent-span"><b>4.</b></span><span>​</span>Limits on state power:</b> The other portion of Marshall’s opinion in <span style="font-style:Italic;">Gibbons</span> dealt with New York’s right to grant a monopoly, and with whether this monopoly was invalid under the Supremacy Clause. This aspect of the opinion is discussed in the treatment of limitations on state power, <span style="font-style:Italic;">infra</span>, p.&nbsp;<a href="../Ch06/Ch06.htm#XREF_31335_7">75</a>. </p><p class="_L4Text"><b><span class="indent-span"><b>B.</b></span><span>​</span>Inactive:</b> From <span style="font-style:Italic;">Gibbons</span> until the late nineteenth century, the Supreme Court had practically no occasion to consider Congress’ powers under the Commerce Clause. It was not until enactment of the Interstate Commerce Act (in 1887) and the Sherman Antitrust Act (in 1890) that Congress’ powers under the Commerce Clause were again seriously scrutinized by the Court. When this scrutiny did occur, the result was much more hostile to congressional power than it was in the Marshall <span style="font-style:Italic;">Gibbons</span> approach. </p><p class="_L6Text"><b><span class="indent-span"><b>1.</b></span><span>​</span>Economic regulation vs. police power:</b> Between about 1880 and 1937, the Supreme Court reviewed (and frequently struck down) two different types of congressional legislation premised upon the commerce power: (1) economic regulatory laws; and (2) “police power” regulations, i.e., those directed at moral or general welfare issues. We consider each of these areas in turn. </p><p class="_L4Text"><b><span class="indent-span"><b>C.</b></span><span>​</span>Economic regulation:</b> The Supreme Court’s review of <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">economic regulatory laws</span> from about 1880 to 1937 was characterized by what has been called a “<span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">dual federalism</span>” approach. That is, the Court felt that there were areas of economic life which, under the Tenth Amendment, were to be <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">left to state regulation</span>, and other areas of activity which were properly the preserve of the federal government. These two areas were viewed as being essentially <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">non-overlapping</span>&nbsp;— either an area was proper for state regulation, or for congressional regulation, but not for both. </p><p class="_L6Text"><b><span class="indent-span"><b>1.</b></span><span>​</span>“Substantial<a id="9530" name="index_9530"></a><a data-indexterm="INTERSTATE%20COMMERCE:Congress’%20power%20over:“Substantial%20economic%20effect”%20on%5BINTERSTATE%20COMMERCE:Congress’%20power%20over:Substantial%5D" id="Substantial%5D" name="INTERSTATE_COMMERCE_Substantial%5D"></a> economic effects”:</b> During this period from 1880 to 1937, congressional regulation was found to fall within the Commerce power so long as the activities being regulated had a “<span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">substantial economic effect</span>” upon interstate commerce. See, e.g., <span style="font-style:Italic;">Houston E. &amp; W. Texas Railway Co. v. U.S.</span>, 234 U.S. 342 (1914), the so-called Shreveport Rate Case.</p><p class="_L4Text"><b><span class="indent-span"><b>D.</b></span><span>​</span><a id="3" name="XREF_13542_3">“Police power” regulations</a><a id="9532" name="index_9532"></a><a data-indexterm="%3C$startrange%3EINTERSTATE%20COMMERCE:Congress’%20power%20over:Police-power%20regulations" id="regulations" name="%3C$startrange%3EINTERSTATE_COMMERCE_Police-power_regulations"></a> and the commerce-prohibiting technique:</b> In cases like the Shreveport Rate Case, <span style="font-style:Italic;">supra</span>, Congress attempted to regulate local activities directly. But Congress also developed a separate technique; instead of regulating intrastate activities directly, Congress used the technique of <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">prohibiting interstate transport</span> of certain items or persons. This “commerce-prohibiting” technique was used not only for pure economic regulatory matters, but also for “<span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">police power</span>” or “<span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">moral</span>” regulation. During the first two decades of the twentieth century, the Court was substantially more sympathetic to this “commerce-prohibiting/police power” technique than to direct regulation of intrastate affairs. </p><p class="_L6Text"><b><span class="indent-span"><b>1.</b></span><span>​</span>The Lottery Case:</b> For instance, when Congress passed the Federal Lottery Act, which prohibited the interstate shipment of <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">lottery tickets</span>, the Court upheld the statute in <span style="font-style:Italic;">Champion v. Ames</span> (<span style="font-style:Italic;">“The Lottery Case”</span>), 188 U.S. 321 (1903). The majority opinion began with the assumption that lotteries were clearly an “evil” which it was desirable for Congress to regulate; since Congress regulated only the interstate shipment of these evil articles, it could not be said to be interfering with intrastate matters reserved for state control. (But a four-Justice dissent contended that only commerce itself could be regulated, and that lottery tickets were not “articles of commerce.”) </p><p class="_L6Text"><b><span class="indent-span"><b>2.</b></span><span>​</span>Regulation <a id="9533" name="index_9533"></a><a data-indexterm="INTERSTATE%20COMMERCE:Congress’%20power%20over:Intrastate%20activities,%20regulation%20of" id="of" name="INTERSTATE_COMMERCE_Intrastate_activities,_regulation_of"></a>of intrastate affairs:</b> Once it became apparent that the Court looked favorably upon the commerce-prohibiting technique as a means of asserting national police power, Congress took a significant additional step: it began to regulate <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">intrastate</span> activities as a <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">means of enforcing</span> bans on interstate transport. Even this extension was generally favorably viewed by the Supreme Court. </p><p class="_M1"><b>Example: </b><span style="font-weight:normal;"> Congress passed the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906. Acting under the Act, federal officials seized a shipment of adulterated eggs after they had arrived in the state of their destination. The right to seize adulterated eggs once they had arrived at their destination was “certainly appropriate to the right to bar them from interstate commerce, and completes its purpose, which is not to merely prevent the physical movement of adulterated articles, but the use of them.&nbsp;…&nbsp;” </span><span style="font-weight:normal;font-style:Italic;">Hipolite Egg Co. v. U.S.</span><span style="font-weight:normal;">, 220 U.S. 45 (1911). </span></p><p class="_L6Text"><b><span class="indent-span"><b>3.</b></span><span>​</span><a id="3" name="XREF_37497_3">The Child</a><a id="9534" name="index_9534"></a><a data-indexterm="INTERSTATE%20COMMERCE:Congress’%20power%20over:Child%20labor" id="labor" name="INTERSTATE_COMMERCE_Child_labor"></a> Labor Case:</b> But the Supreme Court was more hostile to congressional interference with the <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">employer-employee relationship</span>. The Justices were particularly unwilling to allow congressional legislation which was pro-labor, and which the Justices saw as being an unwarranted interference with the free-market system. This was most dramatically illustrated in the so-called Child Labor Case, <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">Hammer v. Dagenhart</span>, 247 U.S. 251 (1918). </p><p class="_L8Text"><b><span class="indent-span"><b>a.</b></span><span>​</span>Holding in case:</b> In that case, the Court voted, 5-to-4, to strike down a federal statute which prohibited the interstate transport of articles produced by companies which employed children younger than certain ages or under certain conditions. </p><p class="_L8Text"><b><span class="indent-span"><b>b.</b></span><span>​</span>Rationale:</b> The majority distinguished this statute from other police power/commerce-prohibiting statutes which the Court had upheld; in those cases, the Court argued, the interstate transportation being prohibited was <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">part of the very evil</span> sought to be prohibited (e.g., the prohibition on the interstate shipment of lottery tickets, where the tickets themselves were viewed as evil). Here, by contrast, the goods shipped in interstate commerce were themselves harmless; it was only the employment of child labor which was an evil, and this employment was not directly related to interstate commerce. </p><p class="_M4Text"><b><span class="indent-span">i.</span><span>​</span>Powers reserved to states:</b> The majority reasoned further that if a prohibition on interstate commerce were permitted in this situation, all manufacturing intended for interstate shipment would be brought under federal control, destroying what the majority said was the Constitution’s reservation of the “power of the States over local matters,” made clear by the Tenth Amendment.</p><p class="_L8Text"><b><span class="indent-span"><b>c.</b></span><span>​</span>Holmes’ dissent:</b> But it was the classic dissent by Justice Holmes that in the long run became the more significant opinion in <span style="font-style:Italic;">Hammer</span>. Holmes argued that so long as the congressional regulation falls within power specifically given to the Congress (here, the power to regulate interstate commerce), the fact that it <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">has a collateral effect upon local activities </span>otherwise left to state control <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">does not render the statute unconstitutional. </span></p><p class="_M4Text"><b><span class="indent-span">i.</span><span>​</span>Tenth Amendment of no force:</b> Thus Holmes’ dissent implicitly rejected the Tenth Amendment as a source of limitations on federal authority&nbsp;— so long as congressional action technically comes within a constitutionally-enumerated power, it is valid <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">no matter how substantially</span> it impairs the states’ ability to regulate what would otherwise be local affairs. This highly restrictive view of the Tenth Amendment became the <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">majority view</span> beginning in 1937, and has endured to the present.

The Act allowed not only the setting of quotas on wheat that would be sold interstate and intrastate, but also quotas on wheat which would be <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">consumed on the very farm where it was raised</span>. Wheat raised in excess of the quota was subject to a per-bushel penalty. </p><p class="_M4Text"><b><span class="indent-span">i.</span><span>​</span>Home consumption:</b> Filburn, the plaintiff in <span style="font-style:Italic;">Wickard</span>, owned a small farm in Ohio.

The Court reasoned as follows: </p><p class="_M4Text"><b><span class="indent-span">i.</span><span>​</span>Consumption has market effect:</b> First, the consumption of home-grown wheat is a large and variable factor in the economics of the wheat market.

But this decision, “taken together with that of <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">many others similarly situated</span>, is far from trivial.&nbsp;…&nbsp;” That is, home-grown wheat “supplies a need of the man who grew it which would otherwise be reflected by purchases in the open market,” and the home-grown wheat thus “competes with wheat in commerce.” Protection of the interstate commercial trade in wheat clearly falls within the commerce power, and the regulation of home-grown wheat is <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">reasonably related to protecting that commerce<a id="9545" name="index_9545"></a><a data-indexterm="%3C$endrange%3EINTERSTATE%20COMMERCE:Congress’%20power%20over:“Cumulative%20effect”%20theory%5BINTERSTATE%20COMMERCE:Congress’%20power%20over:Cumulative%5D" id="Cumulative%5D" name="%3C$endrange%3EINTERSTATE_COMMERCE_Cumulative%5D"></a>. </span></p><p class="_L8Text"><b><span class="indent-span"><b>c.</b></span><span>​</span>Still good law:</b> <span style="font-style:Italic;">Wickard</span> is <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">still good law</span>.

(Recall that the Civil Rights Act applies to any restaurant a substantial portion of whose food has moved in commerce.) </p><p class="_M4Text"><b><span class="indent-span">ii.</span><span>​</span>Application of Act upheld:</b> The Court <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">upheld</span> the Act as applied to the restaurant.

The Court returned to the <span style="font-style:Italic;">Wickard v. Filburn</span> rationale: even though Ollie’s itself was small, and the value of food it purchased from out of state had only an insignificant effect on commerce, the restaurant’s discriminatory conduct was representative of a great deal of similar conduct throughout the country, and <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">this conduct in the aggregate </span>clearly had an effect on interstate commerce.

Here’s a brief summary of these key limiting decisions:</p><p class="BulletParInd"><span style="font-weight:Bold;">“Substantial” effect required:</span> It is not enough that the activity being regulated merely <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">“affects”</span> interstate commerce. Instead, the activity must “<span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">substantially</span> affect” interstate commerce. So, for instance, Congress can’t prohibit possession of guns near schools, because the effect on Commerce of such possession is not substantial enough. (See <span style="font-style:Italic;">U.S. v. Lopez</span>, <span style="font-style:Italic;">infra</span>, p.&nbsp;<a href="#XREF_22260_3">31</a>.)</p><p class="BulletParInd"><span style="font-weight:Bold;">“Non-economic” activities:</span> The Court will be more skeptical of Commerce-based regulation if the activity being regulated is essentially <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">non-economic</span>. So, for instance, Congress can’t allow women who are the victims of gender-motivated violent crimes to bring federal civil-court suits, because gender-motivated violent crime against women is essentially a non-economic activity. (See <span style="font-style:Italic;">U.S. v. Morrison</span>, <span style="font-style:Italic;">infra</span>, p.&nbsp;<a href="#XREF_76097_3">34</a>.)</p><p class="BulletParInd"><span style="font-weight:Bold;">Forced entry into market:</span> Congress may not use its Commerce power to compel someone who is <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">not already active</span> in a commercial market to <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">enter that market by purchasing a product</span>. For instance, Congress can’t use its Commerce power to force individuals to <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">buy health insurance </span>(or pay a penalty if they don’t), even though the collective decisions of many people not to buy insurance substantially affect the interstate market for health care. (See <span style="font-style:Italic;">N.F.I.B. v.

We also review one post-1995 case that went the other way, in which Congress’ use of its Commerce power to regulate some very local transactions (growing marijuana for one’s personal purposes) was <span style="font-style:Italic;">sustained</span>, on the grounds that without such regulation, an entire nationwide scheme for regulating interstate commerce would be jeopardized; see <span style="font-style:Italic;">Gonzales v.

Lopez</span>, 514 U.S. 549 (1995).

For instance:</p><p class="_M4Text"><b><span class="indent-span">i.</span><span>​</span>No findings: </b> The statute did not include explicit findings by Congress that the activity being regulated (possession of guns in schools) affected commerce.</p><p class="_M4Text"><b><span class="indent-span">ii.</span><span>​</span>No jurisdictional nexus: </b> Perhaps more important, the statute <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">did not include a “jurisdictional nexus.”</span> For instance, Congress could have made it a crime only to possess a gun that had moved in (or otherwise affected) interstate commerce. (Congress often uses this “jurisdictional” approach to carry out the “commerce-prohibiting” technique; see, for instance, the 1964 Civil Rights Act, discussed <span style="font-style:Italic;">supra</span>, p.&nbsp;<a href="#XREF_16360_3">29</a>, regulating restaurants that buy food a substantial part of which has moved in interstate commerce.) But this isn’t what Congress did here&nbsp;— instead it <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">banned even possession of a gun that had never traveled in, or even affected, interstate commerce.</span></p><p class="_L6Text"><b><span class="indent-span"><b>2.</b></span><span>​</span>Statute struck down: </b> By a 5-4 vote, the Court <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">struck down</span> the statute. The majority opinion was by Chief Justice Rehnquist, joined by Justices O’Connor, Scalia, Kennedy and Thomas.</p><p class="_L8Text"><b><span class="indent-span"><b>a.</b></span><span>​</span>“Substantial” effect required on Commerce: </b> The majority opinion first resolved a prior uncertainty, by holding that it is not enough that the activity being regulated merely “affects” interstate commerce. Instead, the activity must “<span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">substantially</span> affect” interstate commerce.</p><p class="_L8Text"><b><span class="indent-span"><b>b.</b></span><span>​</span>Requisite effect not present: </b> Then, the majority concluded that the possession of guns in schools had not been demonstrated to “substantially affect” commerce. </p><p class="_M4Text"><b><span class="indent-span">i.</span><span>​</span>Not commercial:</b> The majority seemed to think that it was important that the particular activity being regulated&nbsp;— possession of guns in schools&nbsp;— <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">was not itself a “commercial” activity</span>. The majority distinguished<span style="font-style:Italic;">Wickard v. Filburn, supra, </span>p.<a href="#XREF_38746_3">27</a> (which it called “perhaps the most far reaching example of Commerce Clause authority over intrastate activity.&nbsp;…&nbsp;”) from the activity at issue here, saying that <span style="font-style:Italic;">Wickard</span> “involved economic activity in a way that the possession of a gun in a school zone does not.” Also, unlike the wheat-growing regulation in <span style="font-style:Italic;">Wickard</span>, the regulation here was not part of a “larger regulation of economic activity, in which the regulatory scheme could be undercut unless the intrastate activity were regulated.”</p><p class="_M4Text"><b><span class="indent-span">ii.</span><span>​</span>Government’s argument: </b> The federal government, in defending the statute, had argued that gun possession in schools <span style="font-style:Italic;">does</span> have a “substantial effect” on commerce. The government asserted the following syllogism: (1) possession of a firearm in a school may result in violent crime; and (2) violent crime affects the functioning of the national economy in several ways (e.g., (a) the costs of crime are insured against, and thus spread across state lines because of the interstate nature of the insurance market; (b) violent crime reduces individuals’ willingness to travel to areas of the country they believe are unsafe; and (c) violent crime in the schools reduces the schools’ ability to educate their students, who thus become less economically-productive). </p><p class="_M4Text"><b><span class="indent-span">iii.</span><span>​</span>Argument rejected: </b> But the majority rejected this argument, essentially because it <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">proved too much</span>. For instance, under the “economic productivity” argument, “Congress could regulate any activity that it found was related to the economic productivity of individual citizens: family law (including marriage, divorce, and child custody), for example.” In general, under the government’s approach, “[I]t is difficult to perceive <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">any limitation on federal power</span>, even in areas such as criminal law enforcement or education where States historically have been sovereign. Thus, if we were to accept the Government’s arguments, we are hard-pressed to posit any activity that Congress is without power to regulate.”</p><p class="_M4Text"><b><span class="indent-span">iv.</span><span>​</span>Parade of horribles: </b> The majority went on to describe some of the types of federal regulation that would fall within the Commerce power, if the government’s approach were accepted: “Congress could mandate a <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">federal curriculum</span> for local elementary and secondary schools because what is taught in local schools has a significant ‘effect on classroom learning,’ and that, in turn, has a substantial effect on interstate commerce.” Similarly, “Congress could&nbsp;…&nbsp;look at <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">child rearing</span> as ‘fall[ing] on the commercial side of the line’, because it provides a ‘valuable service&nbsp;— namely, to equip [children] with the skills they need to survive in&nbsp;…&nbsp;the workplace.’ ” Such results would make the Commerce power limitless.</p><p class="_M4Text"><b><span class="indent-span">v.</span><span>​</span>Summary: </b> In summary, the majority said, “To uphold the Government’s contentions here, we would have to pile inference upon inference in a manner that would bid fair to convert congressional authority under the Commerce Clause to a <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">general police power</span> of the sort retained by the States.” Prior cases may have extended the Commerce power to great lengths, “but we decline here to proceed any further.” To uphold the act here “would require us to conclude&nbsp;…&nbsp;that there never will be a distinction between what is truly national and what is truly local.…”</p><p class="_L6Text"><b><span class="indent-span"><b>3.</b></span><span>​</span>Dissent: </b> There were four dissenters (Stevens, Souter, Breyer and Ginsburg), who wrote three separate opinions. The principal one was by Justice Breyer, in which all three of the other dissenters joined. </p><p class="_L8Text"><b><span class="indent-span"><b>a.</b></span><span>​</span>“Rational basis” test: </b> For Breyer, the test was “whether Congress could have had a <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">rational basis</span> for finding a significant (or substantial) connection between gun-related school violence and interstate commerce.” (The majority had not mentioned “rational basis”&nbsp;— to the majority, the question was whether there actually <span style="font-style:Italic;">was</span> a substantial connection, not merely whether Congress could rationally have believed that there was.) With the issue formulated this way, Breyer had no trouble concluding that the answer was yes.</p><p class="_M4Text"><b><span class="indent-span">i.</span><span>​</span>Government’s arguments accepted: </b> Breyer accepted the government’s arguments on this point. There was ample evidence available to Congress that gun-related violence in the schools interfered with the quality of education. And there was also extensive evidence that education was intimately tied to the economic viability of not only individuals but whole areas (since “many firms base their location decisions upon the presence, or absence, of a workforce with a basic education”).</p><p class="_L8Text"><b><span class="indent-span"><b>b.</b></span><span>​</span>Majority’s view rejected: </b> Breyer vehemently objected to the majority’s approach. </p><p class="_M4Text"><b><span class="indent-span">i.</span><span>​</span>Contrary to case law: </b> First, Breyer found that approach contrary to modern cases upholding congressional action regulating activities that (in his opinion) had less connection with interstate commerce than the guns-in-schools at issue here. For instance, he thought that a single instance of racial discrimination at a local restaurant, found regulable in <span style="font-style:Italic;">Katzenbach v. McClung</span>, <span style="font-style:Italic;">supra</span>, p.&nbsp;<a href="#XREF_38018_3">30</a>, had no greater connection with interstate commerce than the instance of gun possession being regulated here.</p><p class="_M4Text"><b><span class="indent-span">ii.</span><span>​</span>Commercial/non-commercial distinction rejected: </b> Second, Breyer rejected the majority’s distinction between “commercial” and “non-commercial” transactions, believing that the line would prove hard to draw. He also thought that the majority drew the line in the wrong place here&nbsp;— if the majority was holding that education as a whole was a non-commercial activity, the majority was mistaken because “Congress&nbsp;…&nbsp;could rationally conclude that schools fall on the commercial side of the line.”</p><p class="_L4Text"><b><span class="indent-span"><b><a id="12628" name="330__L4Capt_12628"></a>C.</b></span><span>​</span><a id="13320" name="index_13320"></a><a data-indexterm="%3C$startrange%3EINTERSTATE%20COMMERCE:Congress’%20power%20over:Violence%20against%20women" id="women" name="%3C$startrange%3EINTERSTATE_COMMERCE_Violence_against_women"></a><a id="3" name="XREF_76097_3">Violence against women (</a><span style="font-style:Italic;">Morrison</span>): </b> <a id="12630" name="330__L4Text_12630"></a> The second major case limiting Congress’ Commerce powers was <a id="Morrison3" name="XREF_U_S__v__Morrison3" style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></a><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">U.S. v. Morrison, </span>529 U.S. 598 (2000). <span style="font-style:Italic;">Morrison</span> suggests that whenever Congress tries to regulate conduct that is <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">essentially non-commercial,</span> the Court will be quick to say that the regulation goes beyond the Commerce power. Just as <span style="font-style:Italic;">Lopez</span> held that Congress can’t ban gun possession in schools, <span style="font-style:Italic;">Morrison</span> says that Congress <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">can’t broadly regulate violence against women, </span>because such violence is essentially non-commercial. </p><p class="_L6Text"><b><span class="indent-span"><b>1.</b></span><span>​</span>Facts:</b> In <span style="font-style:Italic;">Morrison</span>, Congress was concerned that the states’ judicial systems were not taking gender-motivated violence against women sufficiently seriously. Congress therefore passed the Violence Against Women Act of 1994, 42 U.S.C. §&nbsp;13981. The Act announced that all persons within the U.S. “shall have the right to be free from crimes of violence motivated by gender.” To enforce that right, the Act then said that a woman who was a victim of such a gender-motivated violent crime could bring a civil suit against the perpetrator in federal court. A female student at Virginia Tech who said she had been raped by two members of the school’s football team sued them under the Act. They defended by arguing that the act was beyond Congress’ powers, including its Commerce power.</p><p class="_L6Text"><b><span class="indent-span"><b>2.</b></span><span>​</span>Holding:</b> By the same 5-4 split as in <span style="font-style:Italic;">Lopez</span>, the Court agreed with the defendants that the Act was beyond Congress’ Commerce power. The majority opinion by Chief Justice Rehnquist relied principally on the fact that the activity being regulated was essentially <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">non-economic</span>: “Gender-motivated crimes of violence are not, in any sense of the phrase, economic activity. While we need not adopt a categorical rule against aggregating the effects of any noneconomic activity&nbsp;…&nbsp;Thus far in our Nation’s history our cases have upheld Commerce Clause regulation of intrastate activity only where that activity is economic in nature.”</p><p class="_L8Text"><b><span class="indent-span"><b>a.</b></span><span>​</span>Congressional findings not enough:</b> Rehnquist conceded that here, unlike in <span style="font-style:Italic;">Lopez</span>, there were <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">detailed findings</span> by Congress detailing the effect of the conduct being regulated on interstate commerce; for instance, Congress had found that gender-motivated violence deterred potential victims from traveling interstate or from being employed in interstate businesses. However, Rehnquist seemed to give virtually no deference to these findings, because they made for too attenuated a causal chain: “If accepted [this] reasoning would <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">allow Congress to regulate any crime</span> as long as the nationwide, aggregated impact of that crime has substantial effects on employment, production, transit, or consumption. Indeed, if Congress may regulate gender-motivated violence, it would be able to <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">regulate murder or any other type of violence</span>. …”</p><p class="_L8Text"><b><span class="indent-span"><b>b.</b></span><span>​</span>Local vs. national distinction:</b> Rehnquist concluded by relying on the <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">distinction between local and national activities:</span> “The Constitution requires a distinction between what is truly national and what is truly local&nbsp;…&nbsp;The regulation and punishment of intrastate violence that is not directed at the instrumentalities, channels, or goods involved in interstate commerce has always been the province of the States.”</p><p class="_L6Text"><b><span class="indent-span"><b>3.</b></span><span>​</span>Dissent:</b> Four Justices dissented, in separate dissents by Justices Souter and Breyer. The dissenters were especially critical of the majority’s rejection of Congress’ factual findings. </p><p class="_L8Text"><b><span class="indent-span"><b>a.</b></span><span>​</span>Economic / non-economic distinction criticized:</b> The dissenters also criticized the majority’s view that where an activity is basically non-commercial its aggregate affects on commerce cannot suffice. Justice Breyer contended that <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">the economic/noneconomic distinction would be a hard one to implement reliably</span>. (E.g., “Would evidence that desire for economic domination underlies many brutal crimes against women save the present statute?”) He also argued that there was no reason for attaching such importance to that distinction in situations where non-commercial local activities have a large <span style="font-style:Italic;">effect </span>on interstate commerce.

Raich</a></span>, 545 U.S. 1 (2005), the Court concluded by 6-3 that Congress, as part of its overall ban on the cultivation and sale of marijuana, could forbid even the purely <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">intrastate and noncommercial cultivation</span> of<span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"> marijuana </span>for<span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"> medical purposes.</span></p><p class="_L6Text"><b><span class="indent-span"><b><a id="13460" name="330__L6Capt_13460"></a>1.</b></span><span>​</span>Facts: </b> Congress had since the 1970s classified marijuana as a Schedule 1 drug (drugs with high potential for abuse and lack of any accepted medical use), and had made it a crime to manufacture distribute or possess any Schedule I drug. Congress did so in the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). California then, in 1996, by means of a voter-approved Proposition, established an exemption from criminal prosecution for physicians who recommended marijuana to a patient for medical purposes, as well as for patients and primary caregivers who possessed or cultivated marijuana for medicinal purposes with the recommendation or approval of a physician.

(One of them, Monson, grew her own marijuana, which was confiscated by federal Drug Enforcement Administration agents.) The plaintiffs then sued for an injunction barring the enforcement of the CSA against them, on the theory that Congress did not have the power, under the Commerce Clause or any other grant of authority, to regulate the interstate, noncommercial cultivation and possession of marijuana for personal medical purposes.

There, the Court had concluded that when Congress was attempting to regulate the production (and thus pricing) of wheat that moved in interstate commerce, Congress could also regulate farmer Filburn’s cultivation of 12 acres of wheat for consumption on his own farm. Stevens asserted that <span style="font-style:Italic;">Wickard</span> “thus establishes that Congress <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">can regulate purely intrastate activity that is not itself ‘commercial,’</span> in that it is not produced for sale, if it concludes that <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">failure to regulate that class of activity would undercut the regulation of the interstate market in that commodity.”</span></p><p class="_M4Text"><b><span class="indent-span">i.</span><span>​</span>Application to facts:</b> Stevens believed that this <span style="font-style:Italic;">Wickard</span> principle easily fit the facts of the marijuana cultivation here. “Like the farmer in <span style="font-style:Italic;">Wickard</span>, [plaintiffs] are cultivating, for home consumption, a fungible commodity for which there is an established, albeit illegal, interstate market.” And, just as Congress in <span style="font-style:Italic;">Wickard</span> rationally feared that “when viewed in the aggregate, leaving home-consumed wheat outside the regulatory scheme would have a substantial influence on price and market conditions,” so, here, Congress had “a rational basis for concluding that leaving home-consumed marijuana outside federal control would similarly affect price and market conditions.” That is, Congress, in passing the CSA, rationally believed that if cultivation of home-grown marijuana were permitted for medicinal consumption, the high demand in the interstate market would <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">draw that home-grown marijuana into the interstate market</span>, frustrating Congress’ purpose of banning interstate commerce in marijuana.</p><p class="_M4Text"><b><span class="indent-span">ii.</span><span>​</span><span style="font-style:Italic;">Lopez</span> and <span style="font-style:Italic;">Morrison</span> distinguished:</b> Stevens distinguished <span style="font-style:Italic;">Lopez</span> and <span style="font-style:Italic;">Morrison</span>.

For instance, in <span style="font-style:Italic;">Lopez</span>, the Gun-Free School Zones Act <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">did not regulate any economic activity at all,</span> and did not contain any requirement that possession of a gun have any connection to past or future commercial activity. Here, by contrast, Congress’ regulation of marijuana grown for home consumption was merely one of many <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">“essential part[s] of a larger regulation of economic activity</span>, in which the regulatory scheme could be undercut unless the interstate activity were regulated” (quoting language from <span style="font-style:Italic;">Lopez</span>).</p><p class="_M4Text"><b><span class="indent-span">iii.</span><span>​</span>“Economic activity”:</b> Indeed, for Stevens, the activities regulated by the CSA, unlike those regulated in <span style="font-style:Italic;">Lopez</span> (gun possession near schools) and <span style="font-style:Italic;">Morrison</span> (violence against women), were <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">“quintessentially economic.”</span> “Economics,” he noted, refers to the “production, distribution and consumption of commodities.” Since the CSA regulated the “production, distribution, and consumption of commodities for which there was an established, and lucrative, interstate market[,]” and since the Court had long recognized that prohibiting the <span style="font-style:Italic;">intrastate</span> manufacture or possession of an article of commerce was a rational means of regulating interstate commerce in that product, the intrastate regulation here easily fell within Congress’ commerce powers.</p><p class="_L8Text"><b><span class="indent-span"><b>b.</b></span><span>​</span>Scalia’s concurrence:</b> Justice Scalia concurred.

The ACA was adopted on almost straight party lines, with the vast majority of Democrats (and the Obama administration) in favor, and nearly all Republicans opposed. The Act was a broad-sweeping attempt to dramatically reduce the number of Americans without health insurance.</p><p class="_L8Text"><b><span class="indent-span"><b>a.</b></span><span>​</span>The “individual mandate” to purchase insurance:</b> Until the ACA, Congress had never tried to use its Commerce powers to compel an individual to <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">buy a good or service.</span> But in one of many provisions of the ACA, Congress set a “minimum coverage provision,” by which most healthy individuals were <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">required to purchase health insurance</span>, even if they had previously chosen to “self-insure,” i.e., to go without health insurance entirely in the hope of being able to get any needed care for free, or pay for it out of their own pockets at the time of need. The Affordable Care Act referred to this requirement that most healthy individuals must buy insurance as the <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">“individual mandate.” </span>An individual who was subject to the mandate and did not buy the required insurance was required to pay to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) what the ACA called a <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">“shared-responsibility payment,”</span> which was also frequently referred to in the statute as a <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">“penalty.”</span></p><p class="_L8Text"><b><span class="indent-span"><b>b.</b></span><span>​</span>Motivation:</b> Congress reasoned that under the pre-ACA system, healthy individuals had been permitted to self-insure (and wait to get sick), and thereby <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">made</span> <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">insurance more expensive for everyone else</span>. It had never been thought practical to force the uninsured to pay <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">at the time they got sick and needed care</span>&nbsp;— many simply wouldn’t have the money for treatment, and would be left to die. Therefore, federal and state laws, as well as professional obligations, had long required hospitals and doctors to treat uninsured patients for free in emergencies. The substantial cost of this uncompensated care had then traditionally been <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">added onto everyone else’s health-care bill,</span> so that employers who bought insurance for their employees, and individuals who bought their own health insurance, had to pay considerably more (an estimated $1,000 per family per year) than if everyone had insurance. The uninsured were thus, in Congress’ view, <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">“free riders”</span> who received unpaid care at the expense of everyone else.</p><p class="_M4Text"><b><span class="indent-span">i.</span><span>​</span>The “guaranteed issue” and “community rating” provisions:</b> The ACA was not just an attempt to deal with the traditional cost of free-riding by the uninsured. The Act was an ambitious attempt to create a system of <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">near-universal health-care insurance.</span> Two of the most significant ways by which the ACA attempted to broaden the availability of health insurance were by: </p><p class="_M4CaptSubPar list-item"><span class="indent-span">[1]</span>banning insurance companies from <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">denying coverage to sick people</span> (the <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">“guaranteed issue”</span> provision); and </p><p class="_M4CaptSubPar list-item"><span class="indent-span">[2]</span>banning insurers from <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">charging sick people more</span> than healthy people (the <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">“community rating”</span> provision). </p><p class="_M4Text _M4Text--no-indent"><a id="20181" name="330__M4Text_20181"></a>Congress feared that these two new provisions would make the free-rider problem much worse: If Congress did not somehow induce the large numbers of healthy (and cheap-to-insure) people who had been self-insuring to start buying insurance, adding the guaranteed-isue and community-rating provisions would cause rates for everyone else to grow even higher&nbsp;— the insurers would have to start covering lots of much sicker people than before, at the same prices as the non-sick, creating a spiral in which insurers either had to raise prices for everyone, lose money, or drop out of the market. </p><p class="_M4Text"><b><span class="indent-span">ii.</span><span>​</span>Ban on “free riders”:</b> So the individual mandate was seen by Congress as the only way to fulfill the ACA’s overall goal of broadening health-care availability. There would be no more “free riders”: those who had previously gone without health insurance would either have to buy insurance, or else make the shared-responsibility payments. And these payments would be pooled and used to cover part of the cost of otherwise-uncompensated care for the remaining uninsured. </p><p class="_L8Text"><b><span class="indent-span"><b>c.</b></span><span>​</span>No desire to tax:</b> Congress could clearly have accomplished much the same result by using its tax-and-spend power to impose a “tax” on anyone who did not buy insurance.<a id="1" name="Ch04__FNB_1"></a><a href="#Ch04__FNH_1"><sup>1</sup></a> But Congress apparently did not want to be seen to be creating a new tax, so the <span>bill never referred to the shared-responsibility payment scheme as being a tax. </span></p><p class="_L8Text"><b><span class="indent-span"><b>d.</b></span><span>​</span>Commerce-regulation rationale:</b> Therefore, instead of relying explicitly on its power to tax, Congress asserted that the individual mandate and the shared-responsibility payment system together represented a proper exercise of the Commerce power. Congress reasoned that everyone will ultimately need, and consume, health care; even the youngest and healthiest person might well have a health emergency tomorrow, in which case he would receive care without it being practical to charge him at the time of the emergency. Therefore, in Congress’ view, the individual mandate and the shared-responsibility payment system were simply a means of regulating <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">how and when people would pay </span>(via insurance) for a product (health care) that they would <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">inevitably consume </span>even without regulation.</p><p class="_L6Text"><b><span class="indent-span"><b>2.</b></span><span>​</span>Attacked by states:</b> Twenty-six states (nearly all with Republican governors), as well as many other plaintiffs including the National Federation of Independent Business (N.F.I.B.), immediately brought suits challenging the ACA’s constitutionality. Although these suits focused on various provisions, their principal thrust was against the individual mandate&nbsp;— the plaintiffs contended that forcing people to enter a market to buy a product (health insurance) that they didn’t want went beyond the Commerce power.</p><p class="_L6Text"><b><span class="indent-span"><b>3.</b></span><span>​</span><a id="3" name="XREF_36124_3">Majority strikes down Commerce rationale:</a></b> <a id="18247" name="330__L6Text_18247"></a> Five members of the Court <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">agreed with the plaintiffs </span>on this argument: the individual mandate <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">went beyond Congress’ Commerce powers.</span> The principal opinion on this point was by Chief Justice Roberts.

It instead compels individuals to <span style="font-style:Italic;">become</span> active in commerce by purchasing a product, on the ground that their failure to do so affects interstate commerce.” </p><p class="_M4Text"><b><span class="indent-span">iii.</span><span>​</span>Unwarranted expansion of Congress’ powers:</b> Interpreting the Commerce power to permit Congress to “regulate individuals precisely <span style="font-style:Italic;">because</span> they are doing nothing” would, he said, <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">“open a new and potentially vast domain to congressional authority.” </span>“Every day individuals <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">do not do an infinite number of things.”</span> Allowing Congress to regulate based on the effect of inaction on commerce “would bring countless decisions an individual could potentially make within the scope of federal regulation[.]” </p><p class="_M4Text"><b><span class="indent-span">iv.</span><span>​</span><span style="font-style:Italic;">Wickard</span> example:</b> Roberts pointed to the facts of <span style="font-style:Italic;">Wickard v. Filburn </span>(the wheat-growing case, <span style="font-style:Italic;">supra</span>, p.&nbsp;<a href="#XREF_38746_3">27</a>) as an example of how the government’s theory would expand the scope of permissible regulation. <span style="font-style:Italic;">Wickard</span> justified regulating the farmer’s growing of wheat for home consumption on the ground that his growing allowed him to avoid purchasing wheat in the market, and that this decision to grow his own wheat, when aggregated with the similar decisions of others, would have a substantial effect on the interstate market for wheat. But, Roberts argued, “price can be supported by <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">increasing demand</span> as well as by decreasing supply. The aggregated decisions of some consumers <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">not to purchase wheat</span> have a <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">substantial effect on the price of wheat,</span> just as decisions not to purchase health insurance have on the price of insurance.” By the government’s theory, “Congress can therefore <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">command that those not buying wheat do so,</span> just as it argues here that it may command that those not buying health insurance do so.”</p><p class="_M4Text"><b><span class="indent-span">v.</span><span>​</span>The “broccoli” argument:</b> During the public debate on the individual mandate, and in the oral argument before the Court, opponents of the mandate’s constitutionality had made frequent use of the so-called <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">“broccoli”</span> hypothetical: if Congress could force people to buy health insurance because lack of widespread health insurance is bad for the nation, Congress could attack the country’s dietary and obesity problems, and associated health costs, by forcing everyone to <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">“buy broccoli.”</span></p><p class="_M4TextSub2dPar"><b><span class="indent-span"><span class="BoldBody">(1)</span><span>​</span></span>“Vegetables”:</b> Roberts essentially adopted the broccoli argument, though he made it a touch more generic. “Many Americans do not eat a balanced diet,” and therefore become obese. Obese people have higher health costs, which are borne in part by other Americans, “just as the uninsured shift costs to the insured.” Under the government’s theory, therefore, <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">“Congress could address the diet problem by ordering everyone to buy vegetables.” </span></p><p class="_M4Text"><b><span class="indent-span">vi.</span><span>​</span>Fundamental change:</b> But, he said, “That is not the country the framers of our Constitution envisioned.” Congress already has vast power to regulate much of what people do.

The government contended that because sickness and injury are unpredictable but unavoidable, “the uninsured as a class are <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">active in the market for health care</span>, which they <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">regularly seek and obtain.</span>” The individual mandate therefore “merely regulates <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">how individuals finance and pay </span>for that active participation,” by requiring them to buy insurance instead of self-insuring.</p><p class="_M4TextSub2dPar"><b><span class="indent-span"><span class="BoldBody">(1)</span><span>​</span></span>Argument rejected:</b> But Roberts rejected this “mere financing” argument. “An individual who bought a car two years ago and may buy another in the future is not ‘active in the car market’ in any pertinent sense.” The individual mandate primarily affects “healthy, often young adults who are less likely to need significant health-care and have other priorities for spending their money&nbsp;…&nbsp;If the individual mandate is targeted at a class, it is a class whose commercial <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">inactivity rather than activity</span> is its defining feature.” </p><p class="_M4TextSub2dPar"><b><span class="indent-span"><span class="BoldBody">(2)</span><span>​</span></span>Can’t anticipate future activity to regulate it now:</b> Roberts conceded that prior Commerce Clause cases had allowed Congress to <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">anticipate</span> the effects of existing local economic activity on interstate commerce. “But we have never permitted Congress to <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">anticipate that [economic] activity itself</span> in order to regulate individuals not currently engaged in commerce.&nbsp;…&nbsp;Everyone will likely participate in the markets for food, clothing, transportation, shelter, or energy; that does not authorize Congress to direct them to purchase particular products in those or other markets today.

What Congress was doing here with the individual mandate, he said, was <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">not “incidental” </span>to the exercise of the commerce power, and would “work a <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">substantial expansion</span> of federal authority.” Therefore, even if the individual mandate was “necessary” to the ACA’s insurance reforms, it was <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">not a “proper” means </span>of making those reforms effective.</p><p class="_L6Text"><b><span class="indent-span"><b>4.</b></span><span>​</span><a id="3" name="XREF_13875_3">Dissent disagrees on Commerce power:</a></b> <a id="19155" name="330__L6Text_19155"></a> Four Justices sharply <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">dissented</span> from Roberts’ conclusion that the individual mandate did not fall within Congress’ Commerce powers. The opinion on this point was by Justice Ginsburg, who was joined by Justices Sotomayor, Breyer and Kagan. The Ginsburg opinion was only a partial dissent (since these four joined with Roberts to uphold the individual mandate under the power to <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">tax</span>; see <span style="font-style:Italic;">infra</span>, p.&nbsp;<a href="../Ch05/Ch05.htm#XREF_38491_5">60</a>). But the opinion was a vigorous dissent to every aspect of Roberts’ treatment of the Commerce Clause issue.</p><p class="_L8Text"><b><span class="indent-span"><b>a.</b></span><span>​</span>Uninsured are still “active” consumers:</b> First, Ginsburg rejected Roberts’ core assertion that most uninsured were “inactive” in the market for health care. She cited statistics showing that more than 60% of those without insurance visit a hospital or doctor’s office each year, and 90% do so within five years. Furthermore, Congress had<span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"> no way to distinguish</span> between uninsured persons who would soon need emergency health care and those who would not. “No one knows when an emergency will occur, yet emergencies involving the uninsured arise daily.” Therefore, Congress was entitled to require all persons to have insurance, because (quoting a prior Commerce Clause case) “When it is necessary in order to prevent an evil to make the law embrace <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">more than the precise thing to be prevented </span>[Congress] may do so.”</p><p class="_L8Text"><b><span class="indent-span"><b>b.</b></span><span>​</span>Right to anticipate future conduct:</b> Ginsburg also disagreed with Roberts’ assertion that the Court’s precedents did not support the proposition that “Congress may dictate the conduct of an individual today because of prophesied future activity.” She pointed to <span style="font-style:Italic;">Wickard</span> (p.&nbsp;<a href="#XREF_38746_3">27</a>) as a counter-example: Congress had said that the farmer in <span style="font-style:Italic;">Wickard</span> could be prevented from growing too much wheat for home consumption today, because if he did so (and others did likewise), this wheat might <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">in the future </span>overhang the market and depress interstate prices. </p><p class="_L8Text"><b><span class="indent-span"><b>c.</b></span><span>​</span>Health care market is different:</b> Roberts had asserted that the fact that a person might some day need health care didn’t make him “active” in the health-care market, any more than the fact that he might buy a car some day made him active in the car market. But Ginsburg believed that <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">health care was a special case.</span> Roberts’ analogy between health care and, say, car sales was inapt, because “The inevitable yet unpredictable need for medical care, and the guarantee that <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">emergency care will be provided</span> when required are <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">conditions nonexistent in other markets.”</span> Although a consumer <span style="font-style:Italic;">might</span> some day buy a car (or a piece of broccoli), there is no guarantee that she ever will. And if she ever does want a car or broccoli, “she will be obliged to <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">pay at the counter </span>before receiving the vehicle or nourishment. She will <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">get no free ride or food at the expense of another consumer forced to pay an inflated price.”</span></p><p class="_M4Text"><b><span class="indent-span">i.</span><span>​</span>No worry about later expansion:</b> Therefore, Ginsburg said, these special features of the health-care market meant that there was no reason to worry that upholding the individual mandate would logically force the Court to later concede to Congress the Commerce-based power to require the purchase of other products and services.</p><p class="_L8Text"><b><span class="indent-span"><b>d.</b></span><span>​</span>Just a payment mechanism:</b> Ginsburg also rejected Roberts’ characterization of the mandate as “compel[ling] individuals&nbsp;…&nbsp;to <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">purchase an unwanted product.</span>” Since virtually everyone would consume health care, Congress was not “mandating purchase of a discrete, unwanted product.” All that Congress was doing was merely “<span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">defining the terms on which individuals pay for an interstate good they consume: </span>Persons subject to the mandate must now pay for medical care <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">in advance</span> (instead of at the point of service) and <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">through insurance</span> (instead of out-of-pocket).” She concluded that “establishing payment terms for goods in or affecting interstate commerce is <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">quintessential economic regulation.</span>” </p><p class="_L8Text"><b><span class="indent-span"><b>e.</b></span><span>​</span>Active/inactive distinction:</b> Ginsburg also dismissed the significance Roberts attached to the <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">“active”/“inactive”</span> distinction. Most actions can be <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">restated as corresponding inactions </span>with the same effect. She offered the present case as an example: “An individual who opts not to purchase insurance from a private insurer can be seen as <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">actively selecting another form of insurance: self-insurance.</span>” Thus the individual mandate could be described as “regulating activity in the self-insurance market.” Similarly, in the <span style="font-style:Italic;">Wickard</span> wheat-growing case, the statute could be described either as targeting <span style="font-style:Italic;">activity</span> (the growing of too much wheat) or <span style="font-style:Italic;">inactivity</span> (the farmer’s failure to purchase wheat in the marketplace). </p><p class="_L8Text"><b><span class="indent-span"><b>f.</b></span><span>​</span>Necessary and Proper Clause:</b> Finally, Ginsburg disagreed with Roberts’ assertion that the <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">Necessary and Proper Clause</span> did not augment Congress’ Commerce powers regarding the individual mandate. She didn’t see why requiring individuals to choose between buying health insurance or paying a penalty was any more far-reaching than other implied powers that the Court had found to be justified by the Necessary and Proper Clause. For instance, the Court had used the Clause as the basis for implying a congressional power to enact criminal laws, to impose civil imprisonment, and to create a national bank. She predicted that Roberts’ distinction between an “independent power” (not authorized by the N&amp;P Clause) and a “derivative” one (authorized), or between a “substantive” power and an “incidental” one, would prove hard for judges to administer. Roberts was in effect instructing the lower courts, she said, that “You will know it when you see it.”</p><p class="_L6Text"><b><span class="indent-span"><b>5.</b></span><span>​</span>Significance:</b> So <span style="font-style:Italic;">N.F.I.B.</span> seems to establish several important limitations on the Commerce power:</p><p class="BulletPar2dInd">Most significantly, “The power to regulate commerce <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">presupposes the existence of commercial activity</span> to be regulated.” So if the person being regulated is <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">not already engaged in commercial activity</span> of the relevant sort (she doesn’t have to necessarily be involved in <span style="font-style:Italic;">interstate</span> commercial activity, but has to be engaged in at least a local version of the commercial activity), Congress cannot require the person to <span style="font-style:Italic;">become</span> commercially active. And that’s true even if the failure of large numbers of people to become commercially active causes, in the aggregate, a <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">significant (and harmful) effect on interstate commerce</span>.</p><p class="BulletPar2dInd">As a corollary, Congress cannot force a person who is not already engaged in commerce <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">“to purchase an unwanted product.”</span></p><p class="BulletPar2dInd">Even if the person being regulated is likely&nbsp;— or even near-certain&nbsp;— to <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">become active</span> in the relevant market <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">at some time in the future</span>, that’s <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">not enough</span> to justify regulating the person now. So even conceding that the vast majority of individuals will at some point use health care (and Roberts did seem to concede this point), that’s not grounds for requiring the purchase of health insurance <span style="font-style:Italic;">now</span>.</p><p class="_L8Text"><b><span class="indent-span"><b>a.</b></span><span>​</span>Practical impact may be small:</b> But the practical impact of these limits may well prove small. After all, Congress had never before used its Commerce power in what the Court characterized as an attempt to force people into a commercial market in which they were not already participating. So it’s hard to see how this new “can’t force someone to enter a market” doctrine is likely to cramp Congress’ style very much going forward.</p><p class="_M4Text"><b><span class="indent-span">i.</span><span>​</span>Tax-and-spend:</b> Furthermore, the individual mandate itself turned out to be sustainable under the <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">tax-and-spend </span>power. (See <span style="font-style:Italic;">infra</span>, p.&nbsp;<a href="../Ch05/Ch05.htm#XREF_60901_5">59</a>.) So if Congress wants to induce people to take Action X (even if X is the purchase of an unwanted product by someone not already participating in the relevant market), all Congress has to do is to impose a non-punitive “tax” on not taking Action X. To take what Justice Ginsburg refers to as the “broccoli horrible,” apparently Congress is still free to impose a tax on anyone who can’t prove that she purchased a specified amount of broccoli during the year, as long as the tax is small enough that a rational consumer might elect to pay the tax rather buy the broccoli.<span style="font-weight:Bold;"><a id="17627" name="index_17627"></a><a data-indexterm="%3C$endrange%3EHEALTH%20CARE%20ACT:Constitutionality%20of%20federal" id="federal" name="%3C$endrange%3EHEALTH_CARE_ACT_Constitutionality_of_federal"></a><a id="17666" name="index_17666"></a><a data-indexterm="%3C$endrange%3EINTERSTATE%20COMMERCE:Congress’%20power%20over:Forced%20purchase%20of%20good%20or%20service" id="service" name="%3C$endrange%3EINTERSTATE_COMMERCE_Forced_purchase_of_good_or_service"></a><a id="17721" name="index_17721"></a><a data-indexterm="%3C$endrange%3EINTERSTATE%20COMMERCE:Congress’%20power%20over:Insurance,%20forced%20purchase%20of" id="of" name="%3C$endrange%3EINTERSTATE_COMMERCE_Insurance,_forced_purchase_of"></a></span></p><p class="_L4Text"><b><span class="indent-span"><b><a id="10411" name="330__L4Capt_10411"></a>F.</b></span><span>​</span>Summary of the modern limits on the Commerce power: </b> So the major post-1995 Commerce power cases for the most part&nbsp;— but not always&nbsp;— <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">limit</span> Congress’ authority:</p><p class="NumParInd list-item"><span class="indent-span">[1]</span>Where a consumer wants to <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">“make or grow his own product” </span>and the product has a somewhat <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">commercial nature</span>, Congress can regulate or prohibit his activities, even though the consumer is acting in an entirely <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">intrastate manner</span>, and it is only the adding together of many such purely intrastate activities that produces a cumulative effect on interstate commerce. So cases like <span style="font-style:Italic;">Wickard v.

Thus Congress can regulate in a way that is reasonably related to highways, waterways, and air traffic. Presumably Congress can do so even though the activity in question in the particular case is quite intrastate.</p><p class="_L6Text"><b><span class="indent-span"><b>2.</b></span><span>​</span><a id="3" name="XREF_34125_3">Instr</a><a id="11863" name="index_11863"></a><a data-indexterm="INTERSTATE%20COMMERCE:Instrumentalities%20of%20interstate%20commerce" id="commerce" name="INTERSTATE_COMMERCE_Instrumentalities_of_interstate_commerce"></a>umentalities:</b> Second, Congress can regulate the <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">“instrumentalities”</span> of interstate commerce, “even though the threat may come only from intrastate activities.” <span style="font-style:Italic;">Lopez</span>. This category refers to people, machines, and other “things” used in carrying out commerce.

For instance, in <span style="font-style:Italic;">Reno v. Condon</span>, 528 U.S. 141 (2000), the Court said that computerized information about motorists was an “article of commerce” whose release into the “interstate stream of business” made the information an appropriate subject for congressional regulation.

The Act attempted to force each state to make its own arrangements for disposing (either in-state or out-of-state) of the low-level radioactive waste generated in that state. The Act tried to do this with several types of incentives. Most significant was the <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">“take title”</span> incentive, whereby any state which did not arrange for disposal of its waste would be required to “take title” to the waste (upon request by the waste generator), and would be liable for damages in connection with disposal of this waste. </p><p class="_L8Text"><b><span class="indent-span"><b>b.</b></span><span>​</span>New York attacks statute:</b> New York, unlike most states, made little progress in solving its waste disposal problems, because local residents of each community where the state proposed to put disposal sites fiercely objected.

Because Congress could not employ either of these methods alone, it could not escape the problem by giving the state a choice between the two. </p><p class="_L8Text"><b><span class="indent-span"><b>d.</b></span><span>​</span>Dissent:</b> Three members of the Court (White, joined by Blackmun and Stevens) dissented. White argued that this was not an instance where Congress was forcing its will upon the states. Rather, he said, Congress had responded to a request by many of the states to ratify a compromise worked out among themselves, so that the waste-disposal problem could be solved. “The Court’s refusal to force New York to accept responsibility for its own problem inevitably means that some other State’s sovereignty will be impinged by it being forced, for public health reasons, to accept New York’s low-level radioactive waste. I do not understand the principle of federalism to impede the National Government from acting as referee among the States to prohibit one from bullying another.” </p><p class="_L8Text"><b><span class="indent-span"><b>e.</b></span><span>​</span>Alternative methods:</b> Is Congress powerless to make each state deal with its radioactive waste (or any other specific problem)? Probably not. Justice White’s dissent suggests several methods that are apparently still open to Congress, notwithstanding <span style="font-style:Italic;">N.Y. v. U.S.</span></p><p class="_M4Text"><b><span class="indent-span">i.</span><span>​</span>Spending power:</b> First, Congress clearly may <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">supply funds</span> to the states for the purpose of solving the problem, and then <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">condition</span> the receipt of these funds on the states’ agreeing to Congress’ proposed methods for solving the problem.</p><p class="_M4Text"><b><span class="indent-span">ii.</span><span>​</span>Threat of regulation:</b> Second, Congress could <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">directly regulate</span> the conduct in question, and could therefore take the less drastic step of telling the states that this direct regulation will follow if the states do not take care of the problems themselves. (For instance, Congress’ commerce power would entitle it to say, “No state may ship radioactive waste outside of its own border.” Congress could therefore say, as a lesser exercise of this power, “Any state which does not make its own arrangements for disposing of waste, whether in-state or out-of-state, shall be required to keep its waste within its own borders.”) </p><p class="_M4Text"><b><span class="indent-span">iii.</span><span>​</span>Summary:</b> In summary, Congress may have to be a little more clever about how it accomplishes its regulatory purposes&nbsp;— and it will not be able to escape the <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">“political heat”</span> for unpopular decisions by forcing state officials to make those decisions.

The statute is written broadly, so as to cover two friends who bet with each other primarily for purposes of friendship rather than profit. The House and Senate Committee Reports on the bill show that Congress believed that ostensibly “friendly” betting creates a climate that is tolerant of gambling, which in turn increases the interstate gambling profits of organized crime, a multi-million dollar nationwide problem.

State your reasons. _________________</p><p class="_Q2"><b><span class="indent-span">6.</span></b>By 2020, the federal government is paying approximately 50% of total health-care costs for the nation out of general revenues. Congress, concerned that Americans are living increasingly sedentary, unhealthy and medically-costly lifestyles, enacts the Walk to Fitness Act of 2020 (“WFA”). The WFA provides that each American over the age of 16 must purchase and use a specified government-manufactured pedometer, which when attached to the hip measures how many miles the wearer walks each day. The pedometer is sold to the public at a price of $20 (which provides a small profit to the government, made possible by the huge volumes expected to be sold). Another provision of the WFA says that after the end of each year, the device-wearer shall print out the total miles registered on the device during the prior year, and enclose the printout with his tax return. Anyone whose age-adjusted total annual mileage walked does not reach a pre-specified threshold (e.g., 150 miles for a young adult) must pay a “penalty” of $200, payable to the IRS together with the person’s taxes. Exemptions are given for those whose doctor certifies that the person is not medically capable of walking the threshold amount. Congress defends the constitutionality of the WFA on the grounds that the pedometer program encourages fitness, and that fitter people will cause the nation’s ever-increasing health-care bill to decline, leading to a substantial lowering of costs billed in the interstate market for health-care services. Therefore, Congress asserts, the WFA is valid as a regulation of commerce. </p><p class="_Q3">Is the WFA a proper exercise of the Congress’ Commerce power? _________________</p><p class="_Q2"><b><span class="indent-span">7.</span></b>After several years of rising unemployment nationally, and falling wage levels, Congress passes a statute prohibiting the employment of any person under the age of 19. Congress’ intent is to keep teenagers in high school or college, where they may or may not learn something but will at least not be competing with adults for jobs, thus allowing wage rates to rise. The state of Alahoma employs many 17- and 18-year-olds, for such posts as cleaners in state parks and apprentice state troopers. Alahoma estimates that its total payroll costs will rise by 8% if it is required to obey the new federal statute (which by its terms applies to government as well as private-sector employees). </p><p class="_Q3"><span class="indent-span">(a)</span> Assuming that the federal statute falls within Congress’ power to regulate commerce, what is the strongest argument that Alahoma can make as to why the Constitution requires that the state’s own hiring be exempted from the statute? _________________</p><p class="_Q3"><span class="indent-span">(b)</span> Will this argument succeed? _________________</p><p class="_Q2"><b><span class="indent-span">8.</span></b>Congress has concluded that cigarette smoking raises the nation’s annual health-care budget 15% above what it would otherwise be. Congress has therefore enacted a statute that requires each state to: (1) place a tax of at least 10% on the sale of cigarettes (in addition to existing federal cigarette taxes); (2) compile a registry of every premises in the state where cigarettes are sold, and audit those premises quarterly to make sure they’re collecting the tax; (3) modify its health-care financing scheme so that the state does not pay any hospital or doctor for the costs of treating any condition found to be caused by cigarette smoking; and (4) modify its tort law so as to treat cigarettes as a “defective product” for which strict liability is allowed under state tort law. Congress does not allocate any funds for the carrying out of these objectives. It provides that if a state is found not to be in compliance one year after enactment of the act, the federal district courts for that state shall have authority to direct the legislature and agencies of the state to comply, and to hold state officials in contempt if they do not comply.</p><p class="_Q3"><span class="indent-span">(a)</span> If you are given the job of arguing on behalf of a state that this provision is an unconstitutional infringement of your state’s sovereignty, what constitutional provision should you point to? _________________</p><p class="_Q3"><span class="indent-span">(b)</span>Will your argument succeed? _________________</p><p class="_Q3"><span class="indent-span">(c)</span> If you are charged with improving the likelihood that the federal scheme will pass muster, what fundamental change will you urge to be made in that scheme? _________________</p><p class="QuizAnsHead1">Answers</p><p class="_R2"><b><span class="indent-span">5.</span></b><span style="font-weight:Bold;">(a) Congress’ power to regulate commerce.</span></p><p class="_R3" style="font-weight:Bold;"><span class="indent-span">(b)</span>Probably, but this is no longer as certain as it once was. <span style="font-weight:normal;">Before the 1995 decision in </span><span style="font-weight:normal;font-style:Italic;">U.S. v. Lopez</span><span style="font-weight:normal;">, it was enough that there was a “rational basis” for Congress’ belief that a regulated activity “affects” interstate commerce. But </span><span style="font-weight:normal;font-style:Italic;">Lopez</span><span style="font-weight:normal;"> establishes that the activity which Congress is regulating must </span><span style="font-weight:normal;font-style:Italic;">in fact</span><span style="font-weight:normal;"> have a </span><span style="font-style:Italic;">“substantial effect”</span><span style="font-weight:normal;"> on interstate commerce. </span></p><p class="_R3">Where an activity is “commercial,” the Court still seems willing to find regulation of it to be within Congress’ commerce power even if the particular act is wholly intrastate, as long as the act is part of a <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">class</span> of activities which, collectively, substantially affect interstate commerce. See, e.g., <span style="font-style:Italic;">Wickard v. Filburn</span> (farmer’s growing of wheat for family use only can be regulated, because the cumulative effect of all such intrastate wheat-growing decisions significantly affects the interstate price of wheat). The bet here seems to qualify&nbsp;— the bet is probably itself a “commercial” transaction (i.e., one primarily motivated by the desire to make a profit), and private bets taken as a group probably have a substantial effect on interstate commerce (e.g., they are often made over interstate phone lines, they contribute to the use of interstate “handicapping” services and interstate money transfers, etc.). Once the Court finds that the activity substantially affects commerce, the Court requires only that the means selected by Congress be “rationally related” to the objective being sought. Here, prohibition of the damaging activity&nbsp;— friendly sports betting&nbsp;— would certainly seem to be a reasonable means of combatting that activity. The scenario seems a lot like that in <span style="font-style:Italic;">Gonzales v. Raich</span>, where the Court held that Congress could regulate a purely intrastate but commercially-oriented activity regarding a commodity (personal cultivation of marijuana for one’s own medicinal uses) because such regulation was reasonably tied in to Congress’ regulation of the interstate commercial aspects of that same commodity.</p><p class="_R2"><b><span class="indent-span">6.</span></b><span style="font-weight:Bold;">No.</span><span style="font-style:Italic;">N.F.I.B. v. Sebelius</span>, <span style="font-style:Italic;">supra</span>, p.&nbsp;<a href="#XREF_37735__In_the_most_significant_and_controversial_Commerce_power_case_since_at_least_the_1930s%2C_the3">37</a> (the health-insurance case) establishes that five members of the Court believe that Congress’ Commerce powers do not allow Congress <span>“to </span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">compel individuals not engaged in commerce to purchase an unwanted product.”</span><span> The case also says that “the power to regulate </span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">presupposes the existence of commercial activity to be regulated</span><span>.” Since the WFA requires people who are not in the market for a pedometer to buy one, it seems to run afoul of these principles: these individuals are “not engaged in commerce” (at least, commerce of the relevant sort: purchase of walking-measurement devices), and at least some don’t want to purchase the pedometer. So it’s hard to see how the Commerce power can extend to this compulsory-purchase program. That’s true even though Congress is probably correct in reasoning that if everyone either bought and used the device, or paid the penalty, the interstate market for health-care expenditures would be substantially affected.</span></p><p class="_R2"><b><span class="indent-span">7.</span></b><span style="font-weight:Bold;">(a)</span><span style="font-weight:Bold;">The Tenth Amendment.</span> That Amendment provides that “the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the People.” Alahoma could make a plausible argument that Congress, by precisely detailing whom the state may hire, has interfered with the sovereignty reserved to the state by the Tenth Amendment. </p><p class="_R3"><span class="indent-span">(b)</span><span style="font-weight:Bold;">No, probably.</span> At one time, Alahoma would probably have succeeded with this argument, because of <span style="font-style:Italic;">National League of Cities v. Usery</span>, which held that the Tenth Amendment prevented Congress from regulating the states in a way that might impair their “ability to function effectively in the federal system”; state employees were exempted from federal wage/hour regulations on this theory. But <span style="font-style:Italic;">National League of Cities</span> was overruled in <span style="font-style:Italic;">Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority</span>. <span style="font-style:Italic;">Garcia</span> seems to mean that when Congress, acting pursuant to its commerce power, regulates the states as part of a <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">generally applicable regulatory scheme,</span> the fact that it is a state being regulated has no practical significance&nbsp;— if the regulation would be valid where applied to a private party, it is also valid as to the state. Consequently, since Congress would almost certainly have the power to set a minimum age for employment in the private sector (on the theory that this directly affects commerce, because of its effect on unemployment and wage limits), the state is not entitled to an exemption. </p><p class="_R2"><b><span class="indent-span">8.</span></b><span style="font-weight:Bold;">(a) The Tenth Amendment.</span></p><p class="_R3"><span class="indent-span">(b)</span>Yes. The Tenth Amendment does not have very huge scope in light of <span style="font-style:Italic;">Garcia</span> (see previous question), but it has <span style="font-style:Italic;">some</span>. In particular, Congress may not simply <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">“commandee[r] the legislative processes of the States by directly compelling them to enact and enforce a regulatory program.”</span><span style="font-style:Italic;">New York v. U.S.</span> Thus in <span style="font-style:Italic;">New York v. U.S.</span>, <span style="font-style:Italic;">supra</span>, the Court held that Congress could not force states to regulate nuclear waste. So, here, the Court would almost certainly conclude that Congress may not force a state to enact a specific regulatory framework for dealing with the cigarette/health-care problem. Nor may Congress force state official to carry out administrative tasks (such as the audits of cigarette vendors here); see <span style="font-style:Italic;">Printz</span> and <span style="font-style:Italic;">Mack</span>. Congress is always free to regulate health care directly, but it may not thrust onto the states the job of doing this. </p><p class="_R3"><span class="indent-span">(c)</span><span style="font-weight:Bold;">Supply federal funds, and make the loss of those funds the only penalty for failure to comply.</span> Congress is always free to use its power to tax and spend for the general welfare in order to carry out a regulatory scheme. Furthermore, it may do this by giving an incentive to the states to get them to do the regulating. See, e.g., <span style="font-style:Italic;">South Dakota v. Dole</span> (Congress may induce states to prevent underage drinking by withholding 5% of federal highway funds from states that don’t prohibit drivers under age 21 from drinking). So long as the only penalty is “mild encouragement” via a loss of funds that are related to the new congressional program, there should not be a constitutional problem. However, Congress cannot cut off major funding for a pre-existing program that has no relation to the regulatory scheme desired by Congress; thus Congress probably couldn’t cut off, say, <span style="font-style:Italic;">all educational funding</span> to states that refuse to enact the cigarette/health-care scheme. <span>That’s because when financial inducements are combined with conditions, in a way that is “so coercive as to pass the point at which ‘pressure turns into </span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">compulsion</span><span>’,” and that leaves the states with “no real option but to acquiesce,” the scheme goes beyond the spending power. See </span><span style="font-style:Italic;">N.F.I.B. v. Sebelius</span><span>, </span><span style="font-style:Italic;">infra</span><span>, p.&nbsp;<a href="../Ch05/Ch05.htm#XREF_35089__This_result_came_in_the_same_health-care_decision_that_weve_already_reviewed_in_two_other5">63</a></span><span>.
